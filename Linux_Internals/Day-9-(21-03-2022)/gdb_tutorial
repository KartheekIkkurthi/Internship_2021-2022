----------->>>>>	Steps For GDB	 <<<<<----------------

1) Start with gcc  -g  source_code

2)Then using gdb  ./executable_file

3) If we don't use the -g during complilation there shalling be no debugging symbols message pops up.

4) To exit the gdb tool use q.

5) To avoid/hide the instruction provided by the gdb use gbd  -quiet ./executable_file

6) To view the entire program during the debuging use the "list"/"l" command.
		(P.S:- The entire program won't print at once it prints in parts)
		
7) Use the "run" command to run the program.

8) Use "break main"
	--->>The above command make the program to take a break at main.
	---->>>"break"/"b"
9)Use "next"/"n"
	---->> The above command will execute the next function and comes back.
	
10)Use "step"/"s"
	---->> The above function will go step-inside into the function.
	
11)Use "info locals"
	---->>>>Local variables
	
12) Use the command "p" to print any variable during the execution of the program
	----->>> For example p src,,,,, prints the value of src.

13)Using ---->>>>  gdb  --args  ./executable file "Argument"    one can pass arguments in the command line program.

14) Using ----->>gdb ---->>> set args
		------>>It functions the same as step 13
